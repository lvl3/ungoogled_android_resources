# Resources for running Android without Google
Mostly contains links to other sites, but also might contain opinionated information. I've made this page mostly for myself for setting up a new device. Ideas and updates for this page are appreciated nevertheless.

I take no responsibility for any of the software/websites below. Beware and use caution.

## ROMs with microG
These ROMs have microG preinstalled. microG has implemented some of the proprietary APIs from Google. For example you can use Mozilla's location services instead of the ones from Google.
- [/e/](https://e.foundation/) - [Supported Devices](https://doc.e.foundation/devices/)
- [LineageOS for microG](https://lineage.microg.org/) - Supports mostly the same devices as LineageOS
